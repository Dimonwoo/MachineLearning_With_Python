### Colinearity

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Y&space;=\beta_0&plus;\beta_1&space;X_1&plus;\beta_2&space;X_2&plus;\epsilon" title="Y =\beta_0+\beta_1 X_1+\beta_2 X_2+\epsilon" />

* Two independent variables <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?X_1,X_2" title="X_1,X_2" />  are 
* Independent variables(X) having relationshiop with dependent variable(Y).
* By increasing X1 the Y variables should be increase otherwhise it would be insignifigent variable.
* In multivariate regression independent variables - X1,X2,X3,..Xn should not have relationshiop with each other. Otherwise it will be called **Multi-colinearity**
* The result falls between **-1 to 1**.
* The numbers fall between **-0.4 to 0.4** cannot be consider as a co-related.

### Detection
* There are solutions where programmetically detection of colinearity-
   - Bivariate correlation
   - Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
