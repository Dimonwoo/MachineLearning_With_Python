### Colinearity
   
* I want my independent variables having relationshiop with Y.
* By increasing X1 the Y variables should be increase otherwhise it would be insignifigent variable.
* Other hand i dont want X1,X2,X3,..Xn does not have relationshiop with each other. Otherwise it will be called **Multi-colinearity**
* The result falls between **-1 to 1**.
* The numbers fall between **-0.4 to 0.4** cannot be consider as a co-related.
