## What is Machine Learning?
* Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

###  [Lifecycle of ML](https://github.com/iAmKankan/MachineLearning_With_Python/blob/master/ML_lifecycle.md#lifecycle-of-ml)
* Data Acquisition
* Data Preparation
* Hypothesis & Modeling
* Evaluation & Interpretation
* Deployment
* Operation & Optimization

### Supervised Learning
* Supervised Learning is where you have a input variable(x) and a output variable(y) and you use a mapping function from the input to the output


* It is called supervised because the process of an algorithm training fom the dataset can be thought as a teacher supervising the learning process.
