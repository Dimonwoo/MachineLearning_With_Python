> #### A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and versatile Machine Learning model, capable of performing [_linear_][1] or [_nonlinear classification_][1], _regression_, and even _outlier detection_. 
> #### SVMs are sensitive to the feature scales.
* 
* It is one of the most popular models in Machine Learning, prior to Neural Network for pictures and videos SVM was used intensively.
* SVMs are particularly well suited for classification of complex `small` or `medium-sized` datasets.
