* Given a dataset, the algorithm tries to divide the data using **_hyperplanes_** and then makes the predictions.  While other classifiers, when classifying, predict the probability of a data point to belong to one group or the another, SVM directly says to which group the datapoint belongs to without using any probability calculation.
* It is one of the most popular models in Machine Learning, prior to Neural Network for pictures and videos SVM was used intensively.
* SVMs are particularly well suited for classification of complex `small` or `medium-sized` datasets.
