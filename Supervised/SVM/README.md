## Definition
It's a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression problems. But it's usually used for classification. Given 2 or more labeled classes of data, it acts as a discriminative classifier, formally defined by an optimal hyperplane that seperates all the classes. New examples that are then mapped into that same space can then be categorized based on on which side of the gap they fall.
