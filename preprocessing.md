### Feature Transformation
* Feature transformation is simply a function that transforms features from one representation to another. 
* But why would we transform our features? Well there are many reasons, such as:

1. Data types are not suitable to be fed into a machine learning algorithm, e.g. text, categories
2. Feature values may cause problems during the learning process, e.g. data represented in different scales
3. We want to reduce the number of features to plot and visualize data, speed up training or improve the accuracy of a specific model
